# uv2conda

Tiny package to create a conda environment file from a Python project.

The easiest way to use `uv2conda` is with [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/), which is installed with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/fepegar/uv2conda uv2conda
```
